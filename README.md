## Python Review Project

### Overview
#### This project is a review of Python basics, following a YouTube tutorial. It covers fundamental Python concepts, helping to refresh and solidify Python knowledge.

### YouTube Tutorial
#### The tutorial I followed can be found on YouTube and is focused on refreshing Python basics. It covers topics such as:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (if statements, loops)
- Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Recursion, Scope, and f-strings
- Modules, Command Line Arguments and some challenges
- Lambda & Higher Order Functions
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File and Error Handling
- Venv & PIP
- Final Project - Flask Web App


### Purpose
#### The main purpose of this project is to revisit and practice the foundational concepts of Python programming. The code here serves as a reference and practice material for anyone looking to refresh their Python skills.

### How to Use
1. Clone this repo: 
``` git clone https://github.com/AbduLCod3/PythonReview.git ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd PythonReview/Task01 ```
3. Run the Python scripts in the order you prefer: ``` python 01_hello.py ```

### Next Steps
#### After refreshing Python basics, I plan to apply these concepts to more complex projects and push them to GitHub as well. This repository is a starting point for further learning and development.

### Contributing
#### Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests with improvements or additional exercises.
